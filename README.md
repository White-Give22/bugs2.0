# Hello Viewer~~

This is a simple game for you to kill bugs from the websites. Wish you find the bugs of coding and fix them quickly just like in-game. 

# What's in this game?

First, you will see a starting screen where you can adjust the spider's color, which you will use to kill the bug. 

Second, you will click on the start button to start the game.

Third, you will reach the game where the background is a website and kill the bugs to fix them.

Fourth, after you win clear the bugs there will be a button that links to a website that links to other useless websites.

Fifth, have fun with games and also with useless websites. 

# More on the spider 

There will be adding background story of the spider and games on that.

Planning on having a hatching egg game and a hidden spider game as the story is told. 

fix the problem that bugs go out of the screen in the first game(clicking on the bugs to clear).

# Artist Statment 

This is the second game that I worked on p5js. I was inspired by the moment when I was trying to find on the stupid mistakes or dumb spelling mistakes whicht 

took me a long time to find it. Then fix it. So, I wanted something easy to clear the bugs or fix the bugs. I want everyone to have a  esay time to fixing the bugs.

This is a simple game that you play with mouse clicking. After you killed the bugs, you will have a reward which is website for more useless websites.

Try it and waste your time there. I also inlcude the background story for the spider. There is the bug or problem where hatcing the egg with text. This is why we need 

him right.
